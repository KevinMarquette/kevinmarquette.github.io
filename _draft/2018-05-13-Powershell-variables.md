One of the fundamental concepts in PowerShell (and most languages) is the use of [variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_variables?view=powershell-6). They allow you to hold information or data and reuse it later in your script. This looks to be such a simple topic on face value, but there is so much more to learn.

# What is a variable?

Variables are used to store data. This data can be a number or a string or something more complex. Think of them as a named container. Variable names are prefixed with a `$` sign in PowerShell to work with them.

## Assigning a value

We use the `=` operator to assign values to variables. The `=` an equals sign but we call it the assignment operator in this case.

    $myVariable = 1

Here we assign the value `1` to a variable named `myVariable`. We can also store the results of a command to a variable.

    $myServices = Get-Service

Instead of all the services getting listed in the console, they are all stored in the `$myServices`.

## Using a variable

Once you assign a value to a variable, you can then retrieve the value it contains by using the variable name in this way:

    $myVariable = 1
    $myVariable

    $myMessage = 'Test message'
    Write-Output $myMessage

If you just place the variable all by itself on a line, it will place the value on the pipeline (output stream). Because we are not assigning the variable to anything, the console will see it in the output stream and show it to you.

    $myVariable

You can also use variables inside string.

    "This is my $myVariable"

Just know that this was the simplest example and there are multiple ways to get your variable values into strings. Substituting variables inside strings is a whole topic on its own and I have another blog post that covers that: [Everything you wanted to know about variable substitution in strings](/2017-01-13-powershell-variable-substitution-in-strings).

## Default value

Because PowerShell is a scripting language, you don't have to define a variable before you use it. While you should always assign a value to your variable, PowerShell will not throw an error if you use a variable that is not yet defined. You will get a `$null` value instead.

    $null -eq $undefinedVariable

This is an important detail because if you misspell a variable name, you will get that `$null` value that could cause unexpected results in your scripts. The `$null` is a special variable in PowerShell

## Types

Every value and object has a type associated with it. Variables can be strongly typed so that they only contain data of a specified type.

    [int]$number = 1

By specifying that this is an `int` or integer, it can only contain numbers. By typing it that way, you can trust the contents. This is a simple way to add some basic validation. If we try to assign a differnt type, we get an error:

    PS> $number = 'one'
    Cannot convert value "one" to type "System.Int32". Error: "Input string was not in a correct format."

To see the type of a variable, you can call GetType() on it or pipe it to Get-Member.

    PS> $number.gettype()

    IsPublic IsSerial Name  BaseType
    -------- -------- ----  --------
    True     True     Int32 System.ValueType

    PS> $number | Get-Member
 
   TypeName: System.Int32

    Name        MemberType Definition
    ----        ---------- ----------
    CompareTo   Method     int CompareTo(System.Object value), int CompareTo(int value), int ICompara...
    Equals      Method     bool Equals(System.Object obj), bool Equals(int obj), bool IEquatable[int]...
    GetHashCode Method     int GetHashCode()
    ...




# Variable Cmdlets

PowerShell has a few cmdlets for working with variables.

    Get-Command -Noun Variable

    CommandType Name            Version Source
    ----------- ----            ------- ------
    Cmdlet      New-Variable    3.1.0.0 Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
    Cmdlet      Set-Variable    3.1.0.0 Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
    Cmdlet      Clear-Variable  3.1.0.0 Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
    Cmdlet      Get-Variable    3.1.0.0 Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility
    Cmdlet      Remove-Variable 3.1.0.0 Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility

It is very rare for me to ever use these cmdlets, but there are some things that you can only do by using them.

## New-Variable

I was able to create a new variable in my first example by assigning a value to a new variable name. We can use `New-Variable` to also create them.

    New-Variable -Name myVariable -Value 1
    $myVariable

The `Name` does not include the `$` sign when using the `New-Variable` Cmdlet.
