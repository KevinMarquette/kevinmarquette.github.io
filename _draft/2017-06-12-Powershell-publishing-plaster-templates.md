One of the cool things about Plaster is that you can package your templates into [PowerShell modules](/2017-05-27-Powershell-module-building-basics/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=plasterTemplatePublishing). This makes it easy to distribute and share them. You can publish them to an [internal repository](/2017-05-30-Powershell-your-first-PSScript-repository/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=plasterTemplatePublishing) or even share them on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/).

# Our Plaster template

For this example, I am going to take a fun Plaster template that I built in a [previous post called GetPlastered](/2017-05-14-Powershell-Plaster-GetPlastered-template/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=recent). It allows you to take a project folder and turn it into a Plaster template. While that template may be a little complex, the structure to is is very simple.

Right now we only have 2 files inside this template.

## Packaging decisions

We need to decide if we are going to have a module of Plaster templates or a module that is a Plaster template. We can do it either way. I feel like this template kind of stands alone so I am going to package it as a single template module.

If I decide to publish all my other templates, I may do it as a collection.
