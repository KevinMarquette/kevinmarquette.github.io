I wanted to let all my regular readers know that `kevinmarquette.gitub.io` has moved to [powershellexplained.com](https://powershellexplained.com). This is still the same site you were using before with all the same content under a new name. <!--more-->I dive into the details behind that change below.

# What do I have to do?

Please update any links or bookmarks that you have to this site. I am redirecting everything to the new domain. All the old links will still work as long as I am still using my current hosting provider. I don't have any plans to change that yet but the clock is ticking on those old links. There will eventually be a day when they stop working so it is best to update them right now.

# Everything you wanted to know

When I launched this website, I decided to use GitHub Pages. I loved the idea of building my blog in markdown and having it publish every time I merged the changes. I was just getting started with git at the time so it was also a good project to reinforce learning git.

## The KevinMarquette brand

As part of the launch effort, I was rebranding everything under my name. So my account name on GitHub, Twitter, YouTube and everything else became `KevinMarquette` or `KevMar`. I thought it was a good idea to build a brand that pulled all my fragmented efforts together and make them easier to identify as mine. So naturally the default name that I was given for my GitHub Pages site was `kevinmarquette.github.io` and I was happy with it. It was just a blog.

My branding efforts have been a success. All of my content is easy to identify as mine in all the different places where I am creating it.

## Why change the domain?

I was reflecting on the [previous year](https://powershellexplained.com/2019-01-01-Powershell-2018-year-in-review/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=domainchange#blogging-by-the-numbers) and reviewing all my stats for the website. I saw awesome growth over the last two years and I realized something very important. GitHub pages is a free service and there is a limit to how much you can use a free service.

I have no idea if I'm on the edge of that limit or if it's long ways away. I don't care where it is (ok, I care but that is not important right now). My realization was that as long as I was using the `kevinmarquette.github.io` domain name that I would be pinned to the GitHub Pages service. They own that domain, not me. Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderful service and I like GitHub (even after Microsoft owns it). I feel like it is a big mistake not to have an exit plan. Especially now that this little blog has become an important reference site to many people. 

This is why I decided to get a custom domain for my site. I should have done that from the beginning. By using a custom domain, I have the option to move my content anywhere I want because I can always redirect that domain to another service. I'm still using GitHub Pages for now.

## Why change it now?

It is better to act on this now instead of waiting for something to force me to change. I also feel that the sooner I make this change the better. There are already so many links floating around the internet to my content. The longer I wait and the more wide spread my website becomes, the more painful it will be.

I have no idea how this will impact my analytics or how other services measure my site. It's possible that I may take a major hit in search rankings and fall off the top PowerShell blog lists. I am fortunate that those are just feel good internet numbers for me today. I have no income or monetization tied to my site. I'm just doing it because I like to learn and discover new things. So I will just keep doing what I am doing and let the internet will sort it out.

## Why PowerShellExplained.com?

I am breaking from my brand a little bit by going with the `PowerShellExplained.com` domain. I also own `KevinMarquette.com` now so I could use that just as easily. I may be taking a gamble on this but my analytics show that people like me explaining stuff more than talking about stuff. I am also pulling significantly more of my views from search results than direct visitors, RSS subscribers, or social media.

My hope is that `PowerShellExplained.com` is easier for the newest of PowerShell scripters to find and remember. I also hope that seeing the more professional looking uri will help with conversions among those users. My Kevin Marquette brand will still be prominent when you visit the site.

# Thank you

I hope this explanation was valuable and the name change did not cause you any grief. There is a good change that you made it to this page and didn't even realize the name changed until you read this post.
