Saving data to files is a very common task when working with PowerShell. There may be more options than you realize. Let's start with the basics and work into the more advanced options.<!--more-->

# Working with file paths

We are going to start this off by showing you the commands for working with file paths.

## Test-Path

`Test-Path` is one of the more well known commands when you start working with files. It allows you to test for a folder or a file before you try to use it.

    If( Test-Path -Path $Path )
    {
        Do-Stuff -Path $Path
    }

## Split-Path

`Split-Path` will take a full path to a file and gives you the parent folder path.

    PS:> Split-Path -Path 'c:\users\kevin.marquette\documents'
    c:\users\kevin.marquette

If you need the file or folder at the end of the path, you can use the `-Leaf` argument to get it.

    PS:> Split-Path -Path 'c:\users\kevin.marquette\documents' -Leaf
    documents

## Join-Path

`Join-Path` can join folder and file paths together.

    PS:> Join-Path -Path $env:temp -ChildPath testing
    C:\Users\kevin.marquete\AppData\Local\Temp\testing

I use this anytime that I am joining locations that are stored in variables. You don't have to worry about how to handle the backslash becuse this takes care of it for you. If your variables both have backslashes in them, it sorts that out too.

## Resolve-Path

`Resolve-Path` will give you the full path to a location. The important thing is that it will expand wildcard lookups for you. You will get an array of values if there are more than one matche.

    Resolve-Path -Path 'c:\users\*\documents'

    Path
    ----
    C:\users\kevin.marquette\Documents
    C:\users\Public\Documents


That will enumerate all the local users document folders.

I commonly use this on any path value that I get as user input into my functions that accept multiple files. I find it as an easy way to add wildcard support to parameters.

# Saving and reading data

Now that we have all those helper CmdLets out of the way, we can talk about the options we have for saving and reading data.

I use the `$Path` and `$Data` variables to represent your file path and your data in these examples. I do this to keep the samples cleaner and it better reflects how you would use them in a script.

## Basic redirection with Out-File

PowerShell was introduced with `Out-File` as the way to save data to files. Here is what the help on that looks like.

    Get-Help Out-File
    <#
    SYNOPSIS
        Sends output to a file.
    DESCRIPTION
        The Out-File cmdlet sends output to a file. You can use this cmdlet instead of the redirection operator (>) when you need to use its parameters.
    #>
 
For anyone coming from batch file, `Out-File` is the basic replacement for the redirection operator `>`. Here is a sample of how to use it.

    'This is some text' | Out-File -FilePath $Path

It is a basic command and we have had it for a long time. Here is a second example that shows some of the limitations.

     Get-ChildItem |
         Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime, Fullname |
         Out-File -FilePath $Path

The resulting file looks like this when executed from my temp folder:

    Name
    Length  LastWriteTime          FullName
    ----
    ------  -------------          --------
    3A1BFD5A-88A6-487E-A790-93C661B9B904                 9/6/2016 10:38:54 AM   C:\Users\kevin.marqu...
    acrord32_sbx                                         9/4/2016 10:18:18 AM   C:\Users\kevin.marqu...
    TCD789A.tmp                                          9/8/2016 12:27:29 AM   C:\Users\kevin.marqu...

You can see that the last column of values are cut short. `Out-File` is processing objects for the console but redirects the output to a file. All the issues you have getting something to format in the console will show up in your output file. The good news is that we have lots of other options for this that I will cover below.

## Save text data with Add-Content

I personally don't use `Out-File` and prefer to use the `Add-Content` and `Set-Content` commands. There is also a `Get-Content` command that goes with them to read file data.

    $data | Add-Content -Path $Path
    Get-Content -Path $Path

`Add-Content` will create and append to files. `Set-Content` will create and overwrite files.

These are good all-purpose commands as long as performance is no a critical factor in your script. They are great for individual or small content requests. For large sets of data where performance matters more than readability, we can turn to the .Net framework. I will come back to this one.

## Import data with Get-Content -Raw

`Get-Content` is the goto command for reading data. By default, this command will read each line of the file. You end up with an array of strings. This also passes each one down the pipe nicely.

The `-Raw` parameter will bring the entire contents in as a multi-line string. This also performs faster because fewer objects are getting created.

    Get-Content -Path $Path -Raw

## Save column based data with Export-CSV

If you ever need to save data for Excel, `Export-CSV` is your starting point. This is good for storing an object or basic structured data that can be imported later. The CSV format is comma separated values in a text file. Excel is often the default viewer for CSV files.

If you want to import Excel data in PowerShell, save it as a CSV and then you can use `Import-CSV`. There are other ways to do it but this is by far the easiest.

    $data | Export-CSV -Path $Path
    Import-CSV -Path $Path

### -NoTypeInformation

`Export-CSV` will insert type information into the first line of the CSV. If you don't want that, then you can specify the `-NoTypeInformation` parameter.

    $data | Export-CSV -Path $Path -NoTypeInformation

## Save rich object data with Export-CliXml

The `Export-CliXml` command is used to save full objects to a file and then import them again with `Import-CliXml`. This is for objects with nested values or complex datatypes. The raw data will be a verbose serialized object in XML. The nice thing is that you can save a an object to the file and when you import it, you will get that object back.

    Get-Date | Export-Clixml date.clicml
    $date = Import-Clixml .\date.clicml
    $date.GetType()

    IsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType
    -------- -------- ----                                     --------
    True     True     DateTime                                 System.ValueType

This serialized format is not intened for be viewd or edited directly. Here is what the `date.clixml` file looks like:

    <Objs Version="1.1.0.1" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/2004/04">
        <Obj RefId="0">
            <DT>2017-03-17T00:00:00.3522798-07:00</DT>
            <MS>
                <Obj N="DisplayHint" RefId="1">
                    <TN RefId="0">
                        <T>Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.DisplayHintType</T>
                        <T>System.Enum</T>
                        <T>System.ValueType</T>
                        <T>System.Object</T>
                    </TN>
                    <ToString>DateTime</ToString>
                    <I32>2</I32>
                </Obj>
            </MS>
        </Obj>
    </Objs>

Don't worry about trying to understand it. You are not intended to be digging into it.

This is another command that I don't find myself using often. If I have a nested or hierarchical dataset, then JSON is my goto way to save that information.

## Save structured data with ConvertTo-Json

When my data is nested and I may want to edit it by hand, then I use `ConvertTo-Json` to convert it to JSON. `ConvertFrom-Json` will convert it back into an object. These commands do not save or read from files on their own. You will have to turn to `Get-Content` and `Set-Content` for that.

    $Data = @{
        Address = @{
            Street = '123 Elm'
            State  = 'California'
        }
    }

    $Data | ConvertTo-Json | Add-Content  -Path $Path
    $NewData = Get-Content -Path $Path -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
    $NewData.Address.State

There is one important thing to note on this example. I used a `[hashtable]` for my `$Data` but `ConvertFrom-Json` returns a `[PSCustomObject]` instead. This may not be a problem but there is not an easy fix for it.

Also note the use of the `Get-Content -Raw` in this example. `ConvertFrom-Json` expects one string per object.

Here is the contents of the JSON file from above:

    {
        "Address":  {
            "State":  "California",
            "Street":  "123 Elm"
        }
    }

You will notice that this is similar the original hashtable. This is why JSON is a popular format. It is easy to read, understand and edit if needed. I use this all the time for configuration files in my own projects.

# Other options and details

All of those CmdLets are easy to work with. We also have some other parameters and access to .Net for more options.

## Get-Content -ReadCount

The `-ReadCount` parameter on `Get-Content` defines how many lines that `Get-Content` will read at once. There are some situations where this can improve the memory overhead of working with larger files.

This generally includes piping the results to something that can process them as they come in and don't need to keep the input data.

    $dataset = @{}
    Get-Content -Path $path -ReadCount 15 |
        Where-Object {$PSItem -match 'error'} |
        ForEach-Object {$dataset[$PSItem] += 1}

This example will count how many times each error shows up in the `$Path`. This pipeline can process each line as it is read from the file.

You may not have code that leverages this often but this is a good option to be aware of.

## Faster reads with System.IO.File

 That ease of use that the CmdLets provide can come at a small cost in raw performance. It is small enough that you will not notice it for most of the scripting that you do. When that day comes that you need more speed, you will find yourself turning to the native .Net commands. Thankfully they are easy to work with.

    [System.IO.File]::ReadAllLines( ( Resolve-Path $Path ) )

This is just like `Get-Content -Path $Path` in that you will end up with a collection full of strings. You can also read the data as a multi-line string.

    [System.IO.File]::ReadAllText( ( Resolve-Path $Path ) )

The `$Path` must be the full path or it will try to save the file to your `C:\Windows\System32` folder. This is why I use `Resolve-Path` in this example.

Here is an example Cmdlet that I built around these .Net calls: [Import-Content](https://github.com/KevinMarquette/PowershellWorkspace/blob/master/Modules/Kevmar/functions/Import-Content.ps1)

## Writes with System.IO.StreamWriter

On that same note, we can also use `System.IO.StreamWriter` to save data. It is not always faster than the native Cmdlets. This one clearly falls into the rule that if performance matters, test it. 

`System.IO.StreamWriter` is also a little bit more complicated than the native CmdLets.

    try
    {
        $stream = [System.IO.StreamWriter]::new( $Path )
        $data | ForEach-Object{ $stream.WriteLine( $_ ) }
    }
    finally
    {
        $stream.close()
    }

We have to open a `StreamWriter` to a `$path`.  Then we walk the data and save each line to the `StreamWriter`. Once we are done, we close the file. This one also requires a full path.

I had to add error handling around this one to make sure the file was closed when we were done. You may want to add a `catch` in there for custom error handling.

This should work very well for string data. If you have issues, you may want to call the `.ToString()` method on the object you are writing to the stream. If you need more flexibility, just know that you have the whole .Net framework available at this point.

## Saving XML

If you are working with XML files, you can call the `Save()` method on the XML object.

    $Xml = [xml]"<r><data/></r>"
    $Path = (join-path $pwd 'File.xml')
    $Xml.Save($Path)

Just like the other .Net methods in System.IO, you need to specify the full path to the file. I use `$pwd` in this example because it is an automatic variable that contains the result of `Get-Location` (local path).

## Quick note on encoding

The file encoding is the way the data is transformed into binary when saved to disk. Most of the time it just works unless you do a lot of cross platform work.

If you are running into issues with encoding, most of the CmdLets support specifying the encoding. If you want to default the encoding for each command, you can use the `$PSDefaultParameterValues` hashtable like this:

    # Create default values for any parameter
    # $PSDefaultParameterValues["Function:Parameter"]  = $value

    # Set the default file encoding
    $PSDefaultParameterValues["Out-File:Encoding"]    = "UTF8"
    $PSDefaultParameterValues["Set-Content:Encoding"] = "UTF8"
    $PSDefaultParameterValues["Add-Content:Encoding"] = "UTF8"
    $PSDefaultParameterValues["Export-CSV:Encoding"]  = "UTF8"

You can find more on how to use [PSDefaultParameterValues](/2016-11-06-powershell-hashtable-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=internal#psdefaultparametervalues) in my post on [Hashtables](/2016-11-06-powershell-hashtable-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=internal).

# Wrapping up

Working with files is such a common task that you should take the time to get to know these options. Hopefully you saw something new and can put this to use in your own scripts.

Here are two functions that implements the ideas that we talked about
