# Personal/Community efforts

These are the projects and idea that I do on my own time for the community. Most of my personal projects are published on this [blog](http://kevinmarquette.github.io/blog) or as a contribution on [GitHub](https://github.com/KevinMarquette).

* Wrote blog post on [Writing a TypeExtension DSL, DSLs part 4](http://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-05-05-PowerShell-TypeExtension-DSL-part-4/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=recent)
* I saw a post on processing PowerShell help into a graph database and did the same thing with my PSGraph module.
* Wrote blog post on [PSGraph the Get-Help related links](http://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-05-08-Powershell-PSGraph-get-help-related-links/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=recent)
* I started working with Plaster to create templates for the common stuff that I create.
* Wrote blog post on [Adventures in Plaster](http://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-05-12-Powershell-Plaster-adventures-in/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=recent)
* For the fun of it, I created a Plater template that turns a folder into a Plater template, that will deploy that folder as a Plaster template. I went full inception on this one.
* Wrote blog post on [GetPlastered, a Plaster template to create a Plaster template](http://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-05-14-Powershell-Plaster-GetPlastered-template/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=recent)
* Wrote blog post on [Writing an alternate TypeExtension DSL, DSLs part 5](http://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-05-18-Powershell-TypeExtension-DSL-part-5/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=recent)
* I started working with Invoke-Build and I am converting my PSGraph module to use that instead
* I am also reworking my modules to produce a combined psm1 file at build time.
* Wrote blog post on [Building a Module, one microstep at a time](http://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-05-27-Powershell-module-building-basics/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=recent)
* Wrote blog post on [Creating a internal PSScript repository](http://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-05-30-Powershell-your-first-PSScript-repository/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=recent)
* Started working on something big that I hope to announce soon.

# Work/Consulting efforts

I also put a lot of time into Powershell projects outside of my published community efforts. Some of these are hard to explain out of context.

* More work on our universal JSON coalescing and templating engine
