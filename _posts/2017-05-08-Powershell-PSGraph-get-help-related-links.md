I saw this tweet by Glenn Sarti where he was building a graph database of the PowerShell help system as a way to demonstrate Neo4j.

I thought it was a cool idea and I was curious what I could do with my [PSGraph module](/2017-01-30-Powershell-PSGraph) on that same dataset. I am pulling examples right from [Glenn Sarti's article](http://glennsarti.github.io/blog/graph-all-the-powershell-things) because he did a great job explaining it.

# PowerShell help example
His first example shows the data we are working with.

    C:\> get-help get-item

    NAME
        Get-Item
    ...
    RELATED LINKS
        Online Version: http://go.microsof ...
        Clear-Item
        Copy-Item
        Invoke-Item
        Move-Item
    ...

Most help items have these related links. This will let us map the relationship of commands to each other.

# Parsing the help

Glenn has a script on his post that walks the help for every module and cmdlet. He then imports it into a graph database. This is where I am going to take it a different direction. I have a simplified version of his script here that uses PSGraph instead.

    $ModuleName = 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility'

    $graph = graph help {
        $commandList = Get-Command -Module $ModuleName
        foreach($command in $commandList)
        {
            $help = Get-Help -Name $command.name
            $links = $help.relatedLinks.navigationLink.linktext | where {$_ -notmatch 'online version|http:'}
            edge -From $command.name -To $links
        }
    } 

    $graph | Export-PSGraph -ShowGraph

I define a graph and walk each command. Once I pull out the related links, I call the `edge` command to build an edge from the `name` node to the `$links` node. It is ok if `$links` is an array. The `edge` command handles multiple items correctly. By defining an edge between two items, the nodes get created automatically.

I am only graphing one module at a time because too many nodes on a single graph is hard to read. There is also not a lot of overlap between modules so I don't feel like I am missing anything.

# Resulting graph

The resulting graphs can get rather large but here is a cropped sample from the `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility` module.

The whole reason I wrote PSGraph was to be able to visualize data like this very easily.

# Closing remarks

I want to say thank you to Glenn for the idea. I hope he does not mind me building off [his article](http://glennsarti.github.io/blog/graph-all-the-powershell-things/) like this. If you would like more information on how to install or use [PSGraph](/2017-01-30-Powershell-PSGraph), please check [this post](/2017-01-30-Powershell-PSGraph) where I cover it in more detail.
