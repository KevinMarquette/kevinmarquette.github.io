Have you ever noticed that some people use [StringBuilder](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.stringbuilder) in their PowerShell scripts and wondered why? The whole point of using `StringBuilder` is to concatenate or build large strings. There are ways to do this in PowerShell already, so why would someone turn to this DotNet object?

They are trying to optimize for performance because the simple ways to join strings in PowerShell can become expensive very quickly. Let's take a look at this and other ways we can concatenate strings.

# Setting our scope

The focus of this article will be on joining lots of values or lines of text together. Think of the scenario where you are adding to a string in a loop several times. I am not going to focus on the smaller strings where you are just formatting values on a single line.

With that said, I do have another post where I cover [Everything you wanted to know about variable substitution in strings](2017-01-13-powershell-variable-substitution-in-strings).

# What problem does StringBuilder solve?

We should start by taking a look at the problem. Strings in PowerShell and DotNet are immutable. From the [MDSN String Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string) documentation:

> A String object is called immutable (read-only), because its value cannot be modified after it has been created. Methods that appear to modify a String object actually return a new String object that contains the modification.

> Because strings are immutable, string manipulation routines that perform repeated additions or deletions to what appears to be a single string can exact a significant performance penalty.

In this next example, at least 5 strings are created in memory.

    $example = 'First'
    $example += 'Second'
    $example += 'Third'

We have the obvious literals `First`,`Second`,`Third`. `$example` starts with a value of `First`. Then a new string is created with the value `FirstSecond` and assigned to `$example`. Then a new string is created with the value `FirstSecondThird` and assigned to `$example`. All of that sits in ram until garbage collection.

Not only are we using a lot of RAM that is not needed, we create a lot of data copy operations. To create the string of `FirstSecond`, we have to allocate room for each character. We copy in the 5 characters `First` one at a time and then we repeat the process with the `Second` string. When we get to `FirstSecondThird`, the process starts over copying all the characters again. It looks like a simple operation to us, but PowerShell is doing a lot of work that we don't see.

# Using StringBuilder

`StringBuilder` is a DotNet object that builds strings. You can see the basics in this example.

    $sb = [System.Text.StringBuilder]::new()
    [void]$sb.Append( 'Was it a car ' )
    [void]$sb.AppendLine( 'or a cat I saw?' )
    $sb.ToString()

I start by creating a `StringBuilder` and then appending a few strings to it. I am using the `[void]` to suppress the output from the append functions. To get the string from the `StringBuilder`, we need to call `ToString()`.

`StringBuilder` uses an internal data structure that is built for quickly adding data to it. The whole purpose of this object is to address the performance issue that I outlined previously.

## StringBuilder by the numbers

I pulled together a simple test to show how much faster `StringBuilder` can be.

    $string = ''
    Measure-Command {
        foreach( $i in 1..10000)
        {
            $string += 'Was it a car or a cat I saw? '
        }
        $string
    }
    #TotalMilliseconds : 1588.2549

    $sb = [System.Text.StringBuilder]::new()
    Measure-Command {
        foreach( $i in 1..10000)
        {
            [void]$sb.Append( 'Was it a car or a cat I saw? ')
        }
        $sb.ToString()
    }
    #TotalMilliseconds : 127.509

Running over 10 thousand iterations shows a huge gap between them.

# Shifting back to PowerShell

The use of `StringBuilder` comes from the C# or DotNet world. If we change our requirements a bit then there is another option available to us. Sometimes we need a single multi-line string and other times all we need is a collection of strings. If a collection of strings is what we are looking for, we can leverage the PowerShell pipeline.

I have 2 pipeline examples. The first is collecting the output of a `foreach` loop and the second is a function with a `process` block.

## Pipeline by the numbers

Let's run our tests again with these scenarios.

    $sb = [System.Text.StringBuilder]::new()
    Measure-Command {
        foreach( $i in 1..1000000)
        {
            [void]$sb.AppendLine( 'Was it a car or a cat I saw?')
        }
        $sb.ToString()
    }
    #TotalMilliseconds : 1234.2676


    $foreach = @()
    Measure-Command {
        $foreach = foreach( $i in 1..1000000)
        {
            'Was it a car or a cat I saw?'
        }
        $foreach
    }
    #TotalMilliseconds : 846.7726


    function PipelineTest{
        process{
            'Was it a car or a cat I saw?'
        }
    }
    $pipeline = ''
    Measure-Command {
        $pipeline = 1..1000000 | PipelineTest
        $pipeline
    }
    #TotalMilliseconds : 1164.6559

These numbers are a lot closer to each other. I really just wanted to show that we have a few options depending on what our needs are.

# Wrapping it up

There was a time where I would turn to `StringBuilder` quite quickly. As I got a better understanding of the PowerShell pipeline, I found myself using it more for situations like this. It's good to know the options and when you can shift your requirements for better results.

There is a common saying here when it comes to performance in PowerShell that I will leave you with.

> If performance matters, test it.
