Here is a breakdown of all the posts and other Powershell projects that I worked on this month.

# Personal/Community efforts

These are the projects and idea that I do on my own time for the community. Most of my personal projects are published on this blog or as a contribution on GitHub.<!--more-->

* Answered a [call for speakers request](http://mspsug.com/2017/04/26/call-for-mississippi-virtual-powershell-user-group-speakers-2017/) and got myself on the list for presenting in September on my PSGraph module
* Reached out to the ATX PowerShell group to possibly give them the same presentation
* I reverse engineered the advanced features of Gherkin
* Wrote blog post on  [Advanced Gherkin Features](https://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-04-30-Powershell-Gherkin-advanced-features/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=monthly)
* Started working with the new graph database engine in SQL 2017 to see how I could use it with PSGraph
* Loaded my first docker local container on Windows 10
* Wrote blog post on [SQL: Running SQL 2017 CTP 2.0 in Docker](https://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-04-23-SQL-running-sql-server-in-docker/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=monthly)
* Wrote blog post on [Installing remote software](https://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-04-22-Powershell-installing-remote-software/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=monthly)
* Spent a lot of time experimenting with and studying the nuances of exceptions
* Wrote blog post on [Everything you wanted to know about exceptions](https://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-04-10-Powershell-exceptions-everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=monthly)
* Wrote blog post on [All .Net 4.6 Exceptions List](https://kevinmarquette.github.io/2017-04-07-all-dotnet-exception-list/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=monthly)
* I wrote a templating process that mimics the way Plater processes template files because it reminded me of ASP classic and felt like an interesting challenge
* Tracked down an interesting bug in xRemoteFile

# Work/Consulting efforts

I also put a lot of time into Powershell projects outside of my published community efforts. Some of these are hard to explain out of context.

* Built a universal coalescing function to allow us to merge JSON documents
* Implemented a templating system for our JSON documents
* Implemented dynamic tokenizing for our JSON templates

# What have you done?

I was inspired to write this post because every month the [/r/Powershell](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell) community has this discussion. Please stop by and join us to share your projects.

# Previous months

I did this same recap last month.
